🚀 Project Overview
This project analyzes food delivery patterns across states, cities, restaurants, cuisines, and dishes.
Using SQL, the raw data is transformed into meaningful insights that help understand:
•	Order trends
•	Revenue patterns
•	Customer behaviour
•	Cuisine & restaurant performance
•	Rating analysis
The analysis is structured using a professional SQL analytics approach.

🧹 1. Data Cleaning & Validation
Performed essential cleaning tasks to prepare the dataset for reliable analytics:
•	Handling NULL values
•	Detecting blank/empty strings
•	Identifying duplicate rows
•	Removing duplicates using ROW_NUMBER()
•	Standardizing date formats
•	Ensuring consistency across categories and text fields

🗂️ 2. Dimensional Modelling – Star Schema
To optimize analytical queries, the cleaned data is structured using a Star Schema with separate dimension tables and one fact table.
Dimension Tables
•	dim_date → Year, Month, Quarter, Day, Week
•	dim_location → State, City, Location
•	dim_restaurant → Restaurant_Name
•	dim_category → Cuisine / Category
•	dim_dish → Dish_Name
Fact Table
•	fact_swiggy_orders → Price, Rating, Rating_Count + foreign keys
This structure improves performance, reduces redundancy, and makes KPI reporting faster.
